# YouTube-video-no-ads-reopener
Chrome extension to play any YouTube video without any ads.

To use it, download the files into a folder or ZIP archive, and then load them as extension in Chrome settings.

When you are playing a YouTube video, click on the extension icon. The original tab will close, and extension's tab will open in its place, playing the YouTube video.

The video is embedded in "extended privacy mode", so no ads should open inside the extension's own player page. 

Video control, subtitles etc. still work; as part of the embed. Next proposed videos too, tho they display when the video is paused.

The extension should work in all Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
